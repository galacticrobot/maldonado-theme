entry_intro: 'Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass.  All the hands were raised in the air.  Some, tightly closed, seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries an energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote.  The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters.'

The undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall.  Many of the black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height.

"It is evidently a meeting," said Fix, "and its object must be an exciting one.  I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama, despite the fact that that question is settled."

"Perhaps," replied Mr. Fogg, simply.

"At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy."

Aouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg's arm, observed the tumultuous scene with surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was. Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction.  Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd.  Boots and shoes went whirling through the air, and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din, the rout approached the stairway, and flowed over the lower step.  One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the upper hand.

> "It would be prudent for us to retire," said Fix, who was anxious that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to London.  "If there is any question about England in all this, and we were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us."

### He did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood

Fix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see without being jostled about, the party took up a position on the top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street. Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed.
