Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction."

Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass.  All the hands were raised in the air.  Some, tightly closed, seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries an energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote.  The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters.  The undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall.  Many of the black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height.

"It is evidently a meeting," said Fix, "and its object must be an exciting one.  I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama, despite the fact that that question is settled."

>"Perhaps," replied Mr. Fogg, simply. "At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy."
